    "Using Strong Induction with two base cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$h = 0$, This means the AVL has only the root node. So, $n = 1$ and $F_0 = 1$. This leaves $ n \\geq F_0 = 1 \\geq 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$h = 1$, This means the AVL has two nodes, as the height is 1. So, $n = 2$ and $F_1 = 1$. This leaves $ n \\geq F_1 = 2 \\geq 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the inductive step, we let $k$ be an integer such that $k \\geq h$. Therefore $n \\geq F_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the inductive hypothesis is true, we now have to prove that $k + 1, n \\geq F_{k+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A property of AVL trees, as stated above, is that $\\left|\\ \\text{height}(n.\\text{left}) - \\text{height}(n.\\text{right}) \\right| \\leq 1$. This means that the height of the left node can be expressed as $h(n.left) = h - 1$ and the height of the right node can be expressed as $h(n.right) = h - 2$. As $k \\geq h$, the height of any of these subtrees can be at most $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the inductive hypothesis, we obtain that the height for the left subtree satisfies the condition $n.left \\geq F_k$, and we also obtain that $n.right \\geq F_{k-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding both of these together, we obtain that $n.left + n.right \\geq F_k + F_{k-1}$. To obtain n, we have to add 1 to the sum of the amount of nodes on each subtree (this accounts for the root). So, $n = 1 + n.left + n.right$. Adding one increases the inequality on the left side, which has no impact on the condition to be true (as it is greater than or equal). \n",

    "Substituting means that we have $n \\geq F_{k+1}$.\n",

    "Assuming the proof and the above fact are true:\n",

    "We can use this to prove that $h = \\Theta(log_2 n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "As $n \\geq 1.5^h$, for the sake of this example, we'll show that $n = 1.5^h$\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the logarithm of each of this means $log_2(n) = log_2(1.5^h)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be further simplified as $log_2(n) = h * log_2(1.5)$, by using the property of logarithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can either say \n",
    "\n",
    "1) $h = \\frac{log_2(n)}{0.58} = \\Theta(log_2 n)$ or 2) $log_2(n) = h * c_1$ for some constant $c_1$. This also makes $h = \\Theta(log_2 n)$\n",

    "\n",
    "To obtain the appropriate balanced AVL tree now, a right rotation must be done on the right subtree. This means that we did a left-right rotation altogether, to obtain successfully obtain a balanced AVL tree.\n",

    "This approach can lead to false positives. To start off, finding a desired key in the array involves performing every hash on the key and toggling the resulting position in the array to TRUE. Checking for a key $k$ in this manner might lead to false positives, because the hash of a certain key might result in the same position as the key being checked. That position would be labelled as TRUE. This could happen with other keys, resulting in the positions of $k$ being labelled as TRUE even though $k$ never existed in the array. This is a false positive.
