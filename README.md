# Algorithms-Coursework

This repository contains coursework (problem sets and programming projects) done for my CSCI 3104 Algorithms class. The coding portion for each of the problem sets and projects was done in python. During this course, we saw a variety of algorithms; from sorting algorithms, to more complex concepts like graph algorithms and dynamic programming.
